            <h2>Favorite Artist</h2>
            <p> Rihanna is my favorite artist, yeah it is her. Hands down she does alot and is alot. 
                Every been more inspired to do so many things at once like she does, it is honestly amazing. Queen Rihanna is her name 
                as she breaks the odds every time. While being a mom she is an entrepreneur, philanthropist,a business owner so much more.
                That is such a boss move to me and if there is any artist that does it all, she is the one to look up to.   </p>

            <h2>Reflecting</h2>
            <p>Leaving your life of off someone else's standards does you no good. You do you, 
                I have learned that and followed that as I have gotten older. There is less time 
                we spend worrying about someone else because at the end of the day I have to take care of me.
                I know I have high standards and that is me becasue I have seen the proper way of living life
                and more importantly the proper way to be treated.
